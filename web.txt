I learned that browers have their own Javascript runtime engines. I use Google Chrome and it uses the same engine as Node. I can interact with my Javascript runtime through my web console when I open my html files with my server. When I opened home.html file and changed line 18 to "Hello World", my web browser updated once I refreshed it. Everytime I updated or made changes to my html, Javascript and/or CSS files, my web browser would update as well as long as I refreshed and saved my progress. 

There are functions that are built in into my browser like alert, confirm, prompt. I used alert several times for this assessement. We have to use the DOM, document object model, that stores the HTML elements as objects and returns the first element that matches the selector that I am looking for, like a button or a class/id tag. I can get and set attributes. I can create an addlistener that watches out for when something happens, something else needs to happen next; like getting the information after someone hit submit. When I click on a button or a link, I am asking the DOM to retrieve some data for me, my files and have it appear on my web browser. It gets it for me and if there is an error, it notifies me.

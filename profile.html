    <p class="clip">If you happen to click this page, whether it was by accident or on purpose, thank you for passing by. My name is Daravy. It means <i>heavenly star</i> in Thai. Here's a little snip bit about myself. I was born in Thailand but raised in Louisiana since I was 3yrs old. I have one cat and one dog. But my dog acts like a cat because he was raised my cat. I hope you enjoy my content. Please
